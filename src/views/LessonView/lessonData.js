    <h2>Transcript&nbsp;</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>“People often say, <strong>‘BANDALOOP is death-defying!’</strong></p>
    <p>No, we're not. What we do is life-affirming. It celebrates the human spirit, and grace and beauty and</p>
    <p>courage. I'm not a dafedevil. I am a dance-maker.</p>
    <p>BANDALOOP is a dance company that, for 25 years now, has been irmefging the worlds of rock-climbing</p>
    <p>mountaineering with concert-stage dance. And bringing these worlds together, we're able to dance in the</p>
    <p>mountains or on buildings, but in ways that activate those spaces in unusual and wonderful ways.</p>
    <p>It takes a lot of work to make a dream into reality. Doing the hard work, fnding the right people, practicing,</p>
    <p>failing, failing, failing, succeeding. Having the tenacity to keep going and trying to make something that's</p>
    <p>sort of an idea, real.</p>
    <p>The newest member of the company is a young woman named Virginia Broyles.”</p>
    <p>“Since I was a kid I was always interested in how people moved and how to move my own body.</p>
    <p>The more I learned about BANDALOOP, the more it irmade sense to irme, because I'm not losing any of the</p>
    <p>dance that I love so much, I'm just getting to do it in this other relationship to gfavity.”</p>
    <p>“I picked her because she has a really high capacity to learn fast, take movement into her body, which is</p>
    <p>sort of like what I call a physical intelligence.</p>
    <p>“The rotation and the loft and jumping and all these things were really exciting and fun, and then the next</p>
    <p>step is like going on a building and, I was like, oh yeah, I really wanna do this, and then the voice is like,</p>
    <p>okay, but is being on a building gonna just be way too much?</p>
    <p>I defnitely feel adrenaline. Walking up to the wall before performances, I get like really antsy and excited</p>
    <p>and nervous.</p>
    <p>But once something's been feheafsed and you get that practice time in, I guess irmy goal is to achieve the</p>
    <p>state of non-thinking. That's the ideal and that's the most exciting because it just feels like pure</p>
    <p>enjoyment.</p>
    <p>“There you are, hanging off the skyscraper, and people look up and suddenly there's a stage, there's art,</p>
    <p>there's beauty, there's grace, there's power in this site that you oveflook every day.”&nbsp;</p>

    "After Watching":
      "<p>•   What’s another way to say “mix”? What are the things that sky dancing mixes?</p> <p>•   Who’s the newest member of the company and why did the owner pick her?</p><p>•.  What’s another way to say “risk-taker”? Are you a risk-taker? Do you think it’s a good quality?</p>  <p>• What does tenacity mean? Can you give an example of a situation that requires tenacity?</p><p>• What’s another way to say restless? When do you feel that way?</p> <p>• Are you afraid of heights? Do you have any fears that you’d like to overcome?</p> <p>• Some people believe that we’re born with certain talents, for instance for music and sport. But</p> <p>other people feel that anyone can be taught to become a good sports person, musician, etc. What’s</p><p>your opinion and why?&nbsp;</p> ",
